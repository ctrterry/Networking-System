    Stop and wait protocal 
    
    Split by two part 
        * Noiseless channels 
        * Nosiy Channels
    Sender side:
        1, Send one data packet at a time
        2, Send the next packet only after receiving ACK for the previsou
    Receiver side
        1, Receive and consume data packet
        2, After consuming packet, ACK need to be sent (Flow Control)

    Rubric Requirements (All Done):
        1, Correct number of packets sent (3 Points):
            For each file chunk, exactly one data packet is sent (plus one EOF packet).
        2. Sequence of packets managed correctly (3 Points):
            Each packet is constructed with a 4-byte sequence number (using file offset).
        3. Metrics measured correctly over 10 iterations (3 Points):
            Throughput, average delay, and a performance metric are computed.
