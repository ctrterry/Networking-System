    Implements the Fixed Sliding Window protocol.
    
    Rubric Requirements for Fixed Sliding Window:
    1. Correct number of packets sent in each cycle (3 Points):
        - Within each cycle, up to WINDOW_SIZE packets are sent.
        - (E.g., if the file has 10 packets and WINDOW_SIZE=100, then in one cycle 10 packets are sent.)
    2. The window pointers update correctly (4 Points):
        - 'base' (first unacknowledged packet) and 'next_index' (next packet to send)
            are updated as cumulative ACKs are received.
    3. Packet loss handled correctly (4 Points):
        - On timeout, all packets in the current window are retransmitted.
    4. Metrics measured correctly over 10 iterations (3 Points):
        - Throughput, average delay, and performance metric are computed.
    5. Window adjustment technique explained (2 Points):
        - Inline comments explain how the window slides based on cumulative ACKs.
